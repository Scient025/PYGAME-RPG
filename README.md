A simple Python game project focusing on entity interactions and basic gameplay mechanics. 
Currently, it features 4 levels: surfaces, obstacles, enemies, and a player character.

Features
Level Design: Created 4 levels : surfaces, obstacles, and enemies. 

Player and Enemy Movement: Implemented movement mechanics for both player and enemies, with a camera that follows the player's movements.

Map Design: Utilized a hardcoded map for level layout.

Player Animations: Animated player character with sprites from the player.img, wherein each image corresponds to different animation frames.

Combat System: Implemented a simple attack mechanic where the player can eliminate enemies by pressing the space key when facing them.


Work in Progress

Login and Reset Screen: Implement login functionality and a reset screen for better user interaction and game management.
Enhanced Map Design: Work on creating more intricate and visually appealing maps to enhance gameplay experience.
Improved Enemy-Player Interactions: Introduce a leveling system and health bar for both enemies and the player to add depth to combat interactions.
Optional Feature: Consider implementing ray tracing for more sophisticated gameplay mechanics, if deemed suitable for the project's scope and direction.
